# Construction and materials shopping app

## Description 

This project spanned various aspects of full-stack development, utilizing Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and mySQL for the database. Express.js was used for the routing.
To kick things off, I set up the server and configured the essential environment variables. The core functionalities of the application included user management, supplier interactions, raw material handling, production processes, and product management. Testing using Postman ensured the reliability of these features.
On the frontend side, I integrated Angular CLI with Node.js, establishing a connection. With this foundation, I then designe and implemented diverse pages such as the homepage, product management, raw material handling, production processes, and supplier interactions. The overall design incorporated a blend of gray, green, and white tones for a polished look.
The final stages involved linking the backend with the frontend, configuring Angular services for optimal API communication, and conducting thorough testing. Addressing minor issues, incorporating design enhancements, and optimizing the code in line with best practices were crucial steps. The result was a fully functional web application that taught me alot about full-stack development.

### Running the Project
